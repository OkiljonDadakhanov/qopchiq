# Business Profile Authentication Fix

## Issue Identified
The business profile page was using the wrong token store. It was using `useToken()` from the main store instead of `useBusinessToken()` from the business store.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Business Profile Page
- Changed from `useToken()` to `useBusinessToken()`
- Changed from `authClient` to `client` (business-specific API client)
- Added hydration check with `useBusinessIsHydrated()`
- Added debugging logs to help troubleshoot token issues

### 2. Enhanced Business Auth Hook
- Added success/error logging to `useBusinessSignup`
- Improved debugging capabilities

### 3. Added Debug Information
- Added token and hydration status display on authentication error page
- Added console logs for debugging token flow

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clear Browser Storage**
   - Open DevTools → Application → Storage
   - Clear all localStorage entries
   - Refresh the page

2. **Test Business Signup Flow**
   - Go to `/business/signup`
   - Complete the signup form
   - Check browser console for "Business signup successful" log
   - Verify redirect to `/business/dashboard` works

3. **Test Business Profile Access**
   - After successful signup, navigate to `/business/profile`
   - Check browser console for token debugging logs
   - Verify the profile loads correctly

4. **Debug Information**
   - If authentication fails, check the debug info on the error page
   - Look for console logs showing token status
   - Verify business store hydration

## Expected Behavior

After signup:
- Token should be stored in business store (`qopchiq-business-store` in localStorage)
- Business profile page should load successfully
- API calls should include the Bearer token in Authorization header

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify localStorage contains `qopchiq-business-store` entry
3. Check Network tab for API calls and Authorization headers
4. Ensure API endpoints match between frontend and backend

## API Endpoints Used
- Signup: `/api/auth/business/signup`
- Profile: `/api/business/me`
- Avatar: `/api/business/me/avatar`
